            <p>“The Valley of the Moon”, depicted as Mars in several Hollywood feature films Wadi Rum is an Arabian
                fairy-tale waiting to be discovered.
                Home to nomadic Bedouin tribes, Wadi Rum is a quiet getaway of stars, sand, and sun; a perfect
                complement from Amman’s epicenter.
                Once inhabited by the Nabataeans of prehistoric times, Wadi Rum allows you to get lost in large
                landscapes and horizon lines.
                The calmness of the desert is sure to calm your spirit and de-clutter your thoughts. Wadi Rum is waiting
                for you. </p>
