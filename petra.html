            <p>
                The ancient city of Petra is one of Jordanâ€™s national treasures and by far its best-known tourist
                attraction.
                Petra is the legacy of the Nabataeans, an industrious Arab people who settled in southern Jordan more
                than 2,000 years ago.
                Petra is a UNESCO World Heritages Site and one of the new Seven Wonders of the World.
                Inhabited by the Nabateans, Edomites and Romans, Petra brought together the knowledge and skill of these
                civilizations to
                create this world wonder.</p>
